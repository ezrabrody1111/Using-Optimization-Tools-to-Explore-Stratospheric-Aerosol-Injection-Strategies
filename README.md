This repository includes code and data for replicating the figures in the paper:

Brody, E., Zhang, Y., MacMartin, D. G., Visioni, D., Kravitz, B., Bednarz, E. M. “Using Optimization Tools to Explore Stratospheric Aerosol Injection Strategies.” Earth System Dynamics. https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3974

The files SAI_optimization_analysis.m and GAUSS_linearization_test_normalized.m will generate all of the figures in the paper and then some. The rest of the files are data and functions used in the scripts. The two big data files, GAUSS.mat and GAUSS_V_zm.mat are too big for GitHub and are hosted on Zenodo instead.
